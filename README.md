# Binary images analysis

This project is an inttroduction to binary image computer vision. It demonstrates how to analyze geometric properties of objects in binary images using the openCV library

## Features
- Converts color images to binary.
- Detects and analyzes object properties, including:
  - Centroids
  - Major and minor axes
  - Moments
  - Orientation
- Visualizes results on the processed image.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

## Future improvements
-Support for more complex image processing tasks
-Enhanced visualizatios tools
