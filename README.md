# Binary images analysis

This project is an inttroduction to binary image computer vision. It demonstrates how to analyze geometric properties of objects/shapes in binary images using the openCV library.

## Features
- Converts color images to binary.
- Detects and analyzes shape properties, including:
  - Centroids
  - Major and minor axes
  - Moments
  - Orientation
- Visualizes results on a processed image.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/LMamon/Binary-Image-Analysis.git>
   cd <repository-folder>
